generic CMakelist needed for ros and airlib to communicate with each other

note1: at the beginning of the CMakefile you can dump what is labeled as "to be added when airsim communication is desired"
note2: note that  target_link_libraries need to consider the order of the dependecines, so if talker_tmp depends on Airlib You need to do the following:
target_link_libraries(listener_tmp ${catkin_LIBRARIES} AirLib  MavLinkCom rpc pthread ${OpenCV_LIBS})
